# KMeans-algorithm-implementation

k-means clustering is a method of vector quantization, originally from signal processing, that aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean (cluster centers or cluster centroid), serving as a prototype of the cluster.

The algorithm works like this:
Given a text file with points implemented as vectors, and a number k, it is returning k centers of the points and divides the points into clusters.
The algorithm is implemented both in C and in python.
